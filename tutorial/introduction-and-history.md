Fortran (or FORTRAN) is a compiled imperative programming language developed by IBM in the 1950s and is famous for being the first high-level programming language.

It is mostly used for scientific and engineering applications and subsequently came to dominate scientific computing until the C era.

Fun fact: It was designed by John Backus, a guy who is too lazy to write assembly code (you can read more about assembly [here](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language)).
