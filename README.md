Since I was in 4th grade, I've wanted to write some Fortran programs as a way to learn programming and computer history. On my adventure, I quickly found lots of difficulties and it took me a quite to understand what was going on.

I want to write down a tutorial for those who are new to computer science (or interested in Fortran like me!), and I also included [some working examples](/examples). Anyways, This is not an exhaustive guide, but rather an approachable introduction to Fortran.

Reading this tutorial takes as much as **30 minutes**, but you can also spend a **few hours** going through the code examples.

Enjoy!
